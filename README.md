## About The Project
This project aims to benchmark light-weight models tailored specifically for the task of Semantic Segmentation in autonomous self-driving vehicles. To fulfil our desired behavior, models must be balanced between both precision, computational efficiency and real-time responsiveness, a crucial requirement for safe and effective autonomous navigation systems.

## Data
### Datasets
There are many Semantic Segmentation datasets available for the task of Autonomous Driving. The following datasets are used in this project:

#### ➡ Cityscapes ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaose/cityscapes))
The [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/) focuses on semantic understanding of urban street scenes. In the following, we give an overview on the design choices that were made to target the dataset’s focus. It involves **5000** fine and **20000** coarse annotated images for **30** semantic classes.

#### ➡ CamVid ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camvid))
The [Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid)](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) was one of the first semantically segmented datasets to be released in the self-driving space in late 2007. They used their own image annotation software to annotate **700** images from a video sequence of 10 minutes. The camera was set up on the dashboard of a car, with a similar field of view as that of the driver. There are **32** semantic classes for this dataset.
